# Makan-Go-Where-App-Development
Software Engineering project where we built an app to recommend users where to eat. The app will take into account the user's budget and cravings and recommend food places that meet those requirements. The app also takes into accound the user's location, and only recommend places that are nearby the user's position
The main language used was Flutters. This was a group project. The documentation and a video showcasing the app's function can be found in this repository.
